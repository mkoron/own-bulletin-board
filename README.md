# Project 7: Your own Bulletin Board

In this project we will create a simple system for posting and responding to
messages via the Web(something similar to a forum),

Start the server with:

	python3 -m http.server --bind localhost --cgi 8000

Visit the page at http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/main.cgi.
